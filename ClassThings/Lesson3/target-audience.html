                                don't need to turn on sprinklers if it's gonna rain. If it's freezing in the morning
                                then maybe put the sprinklers on later so it doesn't just put ice on the plants/ground

                                they need an umbrella? Maybe it's too windy for an umbrella. Is it just gonna snow out
                                of nowhere?</li>

<p class="dev">User needs? website isn't overly large, want quick loading times. Easy to navigate, find the area you are living (depends on how local the weather forcast are, like if you can tell exactly the block where it will rain and down to the minute it will start). mainly phone usage, a quick check on the weather. Could use PC too so make sure CSS looks good for that. Being able to see weather time and location, being able to see future days, summary of day's weather/horuly weathers</p>

This is a test
How I got here:
Created the repository
Installed the Git App on my desktop by pressing the 'set up in desktop' button
I logged into the app and cloned the repository
On the Git App main menu, I pressed 'open in external editor'

Make sure to know if your project is a public or private repository and to write your notes accordingly. It would not do for people to see me type yeet at the end of every commit haha
